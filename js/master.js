  // select the cars from the DOM (the web page) using the data-ref class. this creates a list of elements; it's like an array, so we can loop through them and do things like add event listeners and change classes one at a time with a forEach method (method is just another word for function)

  // constants are exactly what the word means - something that doesn't change. You can't change or redefine a constant once it's declared, so they're good for things that are meant to be constant throughout the runtime of an app
  var carButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.data-ref');

  // the getCarData function fires every time you click on a car thumbnail; it passes itself into the function (the 'this' keyword referes to the object that called the function => the element clicked on) so that we can use that element's ID attribute as a reference to pass to the query we want to run. We're retrieving a single row from the database where the ID that we pass matches the field we've referenced in the query (in the functions.php file)

It also tracks what iteration of the loop it's on with the index variable (0, 1, 2 etc), which we're not using in the function.

    //
    // template strings are new in ES6; among other things, they let you dig in to data and pull out values, create HTML blobs in JavaScript files, and generally make life a lot easier for JS developers who have had to write hacky ways to do things like this
    document.querySelector(`#${data.model}`).classList.remove('nonActive');
  }

  // loop through and add event handling to each car thumbnail on the page. on a click, they'll fire the AJAX call at the top of the script file.
