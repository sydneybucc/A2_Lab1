  // the getCarData function fires every time you click on a car thumbnail; it passes itself into the function (the 'this' keyword referes to the object that called the function => the element clicked on) so that we can use that element's ID attribute as a reference to pass to the query we want to run. We're retrieving a single row from the database where the ID that we pass matches the field we've referenced in the query (in the functions.php file)

It also tracks what iteration of the loop it's on with the index variable (0, 1, 2 etc), which we're not using in the function.

    //
    // template strings are new in ES6; among other things, they let you dig in to data and pull out values, create HTML blobs in JavaScript files, and generally make life a lot easier for JS developers who have had to write hacky ways to do things like this
